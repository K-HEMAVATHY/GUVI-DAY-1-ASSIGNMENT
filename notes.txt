QUESTION 1 : Difference between HTTP1.1 & HTTP2
*HTTP 1.1 : HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, 
so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
*There is head of line blocking that blocks all the 
requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.	
*It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages	
*It compresses data by itself.	
*HTTP 2 : It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
*It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
*It uses HPACK for data compression.
